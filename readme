Write a function that given a square matrix, it will return the absolute difference between the
sum of its diagonals. (20 marks) (test_name=diagonal_difference)
For example, given:
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9
The left to right diagonal summation is 1 + 5 + 9 = 15.
The right to left diagonal summation is 3 + 5 + 9 = 17.
The absolute difference will be |15 – 17| = 2.
Hint: Consider the input to the function as an array.


Solution



Calculate the sums across the two diagonals of a square matrix.
Along the first diagonal of the matrix, row index = column index i.e mat[i][j] lies on the first diagonal if i = j.
Along the other diagonal, row index = n – 1 – column index i.e mat[i][j] lies on the second diagonal if i = n-1-j. 
By using two loops we traverse the entire matrix and calculate the sum across the diagonals of the matrix.
Below is the implementation of this approach:
